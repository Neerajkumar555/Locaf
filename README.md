## Motivation 
This project was created for COMP1800 Projects 1 from the British Columbia Institute of Technology in the Computer Systems Technology program. Our goal for this project was to gain experience regarding planning a product, analyzing the market needs, developing a working prototype, and implementing a viable solution. 

Through the shared desire of finding safe, viable locations to study (as well as for a good grade), we have implemented Locaf, a curated search-engine that takes inspiration from apps such as Yelp to deliver a comfortable user experience that targets the student as well as working professional demographics.
